Model, rendering, and manipulation of 2D points with constraints
  Move a point around
  Create a constraint
    Fixed distance between 2 points
    Fixed angle between 2 points
    # Fixed angle between 3 points
    # Equal distance between 2 pairs of points





Point on line
Point on circle (done)




"Derived" points
  midpoint
  intersection
  point on line (removes 1 degree)
  point on circle (removes 1 degree)
    should it control the radius of the circle?
